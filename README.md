The Mad River School District has decided to provide its elementary school students with the opportunity to practice and improve their Math skills. To fulfill this need, the school district applied for a grant to pay for any necessary software, hardware, as well as training and recently received notification it was awarded the grant! The exciting news is that the funding for the grant is largely non-discretionary, with the goal of developing software using technology that best helps elementary-aged school kids learn spelling. The school district currently has a computer lab in each school, running a collection of Windows PCs and well as Macs. However, the nature of the grant will allow the school district to upgrade the machines – or purchase tablets – per the software requirements. 

Your company has been selected to develop the Math game software for the 1st and 2nd graders (6 and 7-year olds). If this software is successful, then the software for the subsequent grades may also be awarded to your company. 
 
In 14 weeks you will deliver the final product to the school district. Intermediary releases will enable continuous feedback.  The students and teachers in the district’s classrooms and computer labs will use the final product. The success of this project is critical, as the students need assistance in their math skills as they prepare for the state’s standardized tests.
